By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand when bubble charts are effective, how to construct them using Plotly Express, and how to enhance them with transparency and labels. You'll practice filtering data, adjusting visual elements, and using Plotly's built-in text capabilities for clear labeling. These skills will enable you to visualize complex relationships between three variables, a powerful tool for uncovering and communicating insights in your data journalism projects."

You've practiced transforming scatterplots into bubble charts by mapping a variable to the `size` aesthetic, adjusting transparency (`opacity`) and maximum bubble size (`size_max`) for clarity, and adding labels to highlight key data points. Remember, while bubble charts can be powerful for showing an additional dimension of data, they're most effective when used judiciously - when the relationships between all three variables tell a compelling story and the chart doesn't become too cluttered. Going forward, consider how bubble charts might reveal hidden patterns in your datasets, but always balance their complexity with the clarity of your message."
