                "Throughout this lesson, you've explored the power of color in data visualization and learned how to use it judiciously to enhance your charts. You've practiced creating a base chart, using color to fade less important elements into the background, and highlighting key data points with contrasting colors. Remember, effective use of color is about balance - drawing attention to the most important aspects of your data while avoiding visual clutter. Consider how thoughtful color choices can make your visualizations more engaging and easier to understand, ultimately helping you tell stronger data-driven stories."

                "- **`barmode='overlay'`**: In `fig.update_layout()`, when multiple bar traces share the same categories, `'overlay'` draws them on top of each other. Useful for highlighting."
