    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This introductory lesson aims to familiarize you with the fundamental concepts of Python programming in the context of data journalism. The primary goal is to help learners understand the basic syntax of Python, its function as a calculator, and the crucial concept of variables. By the end of this tutorial, you should be comfortable with simple mathematical operations in Python, understand the importance of order in calculations (PEMDAS), and grasp the basics of creating and using variables to store both numeric and string data."

It is a skill and a philosophy. And it can't be easily summarized in a single section of a textbook, so we're not going to do that. We'll take it in chunks, and maybe we'll get somewhere by the end. \n",

    "\n",
    "\"I didn't even know spreadsheets existed when I was a beginner reporter,\" she said. \"I was covering the police beat, and I had to write about the city budget, and the police department's budget looked like it was going up a lot. So I had done the percentage change calculation year over year and saw that it was very high. Then I wanted to be able to say, how does that compare to all the other departments in the city?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What did she do? She pulled out a calculator and started doing the calculations one by one. As she was doing this, a colleague walked by and suggested a spreadsheet. He showed her how to write a formula that would calculate percent change, and then how to apply that formula to every city department. Boom -- hours of tedious calculations done in one click.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My jaw was on the floor going, what?\" Webster said. \"That was amazing to me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon, you will be able to take tens of thousands of rows of data and turn that into information that you can turn into a story or a graphic. You'll know how to ask questions of data, what number is the right number in this spot, and how to get answers that readers want -- what's the biggest, the smallest, the fastest growing, declining the quickest, the most dangerous, and many, many other things that make news."

    "Python is a programming language, one specifically geared toward a wide range of applications including data analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain built-in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The first, and most basic, is the console or \"interpreter\". Think of the console like talking directly to Python. It's direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we'll get into later.\n",

    "For now, we're going to use code cells in this notebook to interact with Python. You'll type commands into the code cells below and run them. Be sure that you're reading closely -- things like spaces, capitalization, and spelling all matter. Some things matter to the point that if you miss them, the code won't work. Other things are stylistic. It takes time and practice to know the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear: Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone makes dumb mistakes. Everyone overlooks dumb mistakes for hours only to be shown the missing comma. *You aren't dumb*. You're like every single person who has ever tried to learn how to code.\n",

If you miss a day, tune out for a class, or just never get around to asking what something means, you'll be lost. So let's just cover some bases and make sure we all understand some ultra-basic notation.\n",

A string is just text. Your name is a string. Your home address is a string. For the most part, strings aren't hard -- they're anything you wouldn't do math on. So, for example, your phone number is a string, even though it's made up of numbers. If we add your phone number to mine, do we get something meaningful? No. Same with ZIP codes. They're strings.\n",

We then explored the concept of variables, learning how to create them, name them effectively, and assign different types of values (numbers and strings) to them. We practiced these skills by calculating the percentage change in population and natural population change, demonstrating how these basic concepts can be applied to real-world data analysis tasks.
