You've practiced preparing date data, creating basic single-line charts, and expanding to multi-line charts to compare different states over time. You've seen how line charts can reveal trends, such as the impact of the pandemic on employment across the country, and how to highlight specific series for comparison. Remember, while line charts are powerful tools for visualizing temporal data, they're just the starting point. The patterns you discover should lead to further questions and deeper reporting to uncover the full story behind the numbers."
