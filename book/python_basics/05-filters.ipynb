    "In this lesson, you'll learn about filtering data - a crucial skill for focusing your analysis on specific subsets of information. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to use boolean indexing and the `.query()` method in pandas to narrow down your DataFrame based on various criteria. You'll practice filtering with exact matches, partial matches using string methods, and filtering with lists. You'll also learn how to combine multiple filters and use column selection to simplify your data view. These skills will enable you to efficiently extract the most relevant information from large datasets, a key ability in data journalism."

They do not care about what's going on a thousand miles away. They *really* care about what's going on their neighborhood, their city, their county and so on.

So equal is `==` and NOT equal is `!=`. You can also combine greater than and equal to. So, for instance, if you want all values that are 10 or greater, you can use `>= 10`, which is the same thing as `> 9`. Both will include 10 and everything greater. But one is more clear – `>= 10` – and one is a trick. Always be clear."

    "\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, you've learned how to use filters to focus on specific parts of your dataset using pandas. You've practiced filtering with exact matches (boolean indexing), using `.str.contains()` for partial matches, and filtering with lists using `.isin()`. You've also learned how to chain multiple operations together and use column selection (`df[['col1', ...]]`) to simplify your data view. Remember, filtering is a powerful tool that allows you to zoom in on the most relevant data for your story. You'll find these filtering techniques invaluable for uncovering specific trends and patterns within larger datasets."

    "- **Boolean Indexing**: Using a boolean Series (True/False) to select rows from a DataFrame (e.g., `df[df['col'] > 10]`).\n",
    "- **Column Selection**: Choosing specific columns from a DataFrame (e.g., `df[['col_a', 'col_b']]`).\n",
    "- **`.str.contains()`**: A pandas string method used for partial string matching within a Series.\n",
    "- **Comparison Operators**: Symbols used in filtering (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`) to compare values.\n",
    "- **Logical Operators**: Used to combine boolean conditions (`&` for AND, `|` for OR, `~` for NOT).\n",
    "- **`.isin()`**: A pandas method used to check if values in a Series are present in a given list or set.\n",
    "- **List**: A Python data structure used to hold an ordered sequence of items (`[]`).\n",
    "- **Method Chaining**: Connecting multiple pandas operations together, often making code more readable.\n",
    "- **`.head(N)`**: A pandas method used to select the first N rows of a DataFrame or Series."
