The number of high school graduates has been going up for decades. But as of 2025, no longer. It'll drop. By some estimates, there will be 400,000 fewer college-bound high school graduates by 2030. That might not seem like a lot when you figure there's 345 million people in the United States, but that 400,000 student decline would be 4/5ths of the undergrads at the 18 Big Ten campuses *combined*. \n",

The key feature is that the dots within each category are adjusted (usually along the axis perpendicular to the category grouping) to prevent overlap, forming characteristic 'swarms'.
