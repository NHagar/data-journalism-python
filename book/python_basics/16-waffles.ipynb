You've practiced making single waffle charts to display proportions within a dataset, such as the partisan makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives. You've also learned how to create comparative waffle charts by manually setting up subplots, allowing you to visually compare proportions across different facets (states). You've discovered how to adjust your data and chart parameters to handle issues like scale differences and visual clarity. Remember, waffle charts offer a more precise and visually appealing alternative to pie charts for displaying proportional data, making them a valuable tool in your data visualization toolkit."
