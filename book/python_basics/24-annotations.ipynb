By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to craft compelling headlines, write informative subtitles, add clear axis labels, and use strategic annotations to guide readers through your charts. You'll practice applying these text elements to a scatterplot, gaining hands-on experience in transforming raw data into a story-driven visualization. These skills will enable you to create more impactful and informative graphics that effectively communicate your data stories to readers."

You've practiced writing headlines that grab attention and convey the main story, crafting subtitles that provide context, and adding clear labels to guide readers through your chart. You've also explored how to use annotations to highlight key insights and divide your chart into meaningful sections. Remember, effective data journalism isn't just about the numbers â€” it's about using text strategically to tell a compelling story. As you continue to create visualizations, always consider how you can use headlines, labels, and annotations to make your charts more accessible and impactful for your audience."
