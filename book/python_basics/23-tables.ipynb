You'll practice these skills using real-world data on estimates of people who have health insurance, gaining practical experience in presenting complex information in a clear, tabular format. This ability to create professional-looking tables directly from your DataFrames will be invaluable for effectively communicating data findings in your journalism projects."

The answer is pretty simple, once you think about it – in the United States, Medicare kicks in for people 65 and over. If you dig into the SAHIE docs, they cut their data off at 64. What this all means is that the numbers we’re looking at are the estimates of non-Medicare aged people. So something to keep in mind when wording certain things later."

You’ve learned to transform raw data into structured, easy-to-read tables by customizing headers, applying styles, and highlighting key information. Remember, effective tables strike a balance between informativeness and visual appeal. You’ll find that well-designed tables can be powerful tools for presenting complex data in a format that’s accessible to your audience. Keep experimenting with different styling options to find the perfect balance for your specific data and story needs."
