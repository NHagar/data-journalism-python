You'll practice these skills using real-world college completion and cost data, gaining insight into how to uncover and communicate trends and outliers in your datasets.

He's written four books in English about data visualization -- *The Functional Art* (2013), *The Truthful Art* (2016), *How Charts Lie* (2019) and *The Art of Insight* (2023). If you're serious about data visualization, you own these books and if he is speaking somewhere near you, you go and you listen. \n",

                "I was hooked early by Cairo's vision for data visualization -- and the kind of person who does the work -- from the first chapter of *The Functional Art*. Specifically, he wrote that \"the life of a visual communicator should be one of systematic and exciting intellectual chaos.\" I felt like my own read-anything-that-catches-my-attention lifestyle was all okay now. Intellectual curiosity -- spread far and wide -- leads to inspiration, which leads to all kinds of interesting things. \n",

On the other is Cairo, talking about art and creativity and how rules can squash something great into something mediocre. \n",

                "In August 2023, Cairo made an appearance on the Real World Data Science podcast to talk about his not-yet-released book *The Art of Insight*. In it, he talked about how visualization is like language in that it has dialects. The dialects of data viz are the places that use them -- journalism, science, industry, art, and others. The rules for how we write in journalism, for example, are vastly different from how we write in the sciences. So why are we trying to create rigid rules for all data visualization? \n",
                "\n",
                "\"There are really no universal rules in data visualization: they are parochial rules that are applicable to the different dialects,\" Cairo said. \"But it is wrong -- it is a mistake -- to apply the standards of one of the dialects of data visualization to a completely different dialect of data visualization.\" \n",

We know that there's empirical evidence behind that so you can sort of like derive a principle out of that, right, but beyond those very basic things there are really not many rules.\"\n",

                "Today we're working with what I believe is the most versatile and interpretive graph type around -- the scatterplot. What makes the scatterplot so great? You use it to compare two dimensions of data -- so your x and y are both numbers. That means the space and the arrangement of dots in it is meaningful. If they cluster together? That means something. If they arrange along a path going up and to the right? Meaningful. Down and right? Meaningful. You can even turn the space into quadrants -- above and below average on your two dimensions of data -- and where dots appear means something. And, unlike many other graphical types, scatterplots are better, in my opinion, when there is *more* data. A scatterplot with just a few points isn't a very compelling scatterplot. A scatterplot with *thousands* can be."

Or is it that the more expensive the school, the more likely those people graduate? Maybe they only let smart people in. Maybe they only let rich people in who don't worry about the cost.

You've learned how to plot multiple data points to reveal overall trends, highlight specific points of interest by adding and styling traces, and add text labels to key data points. Remember, scatterplots are excellent for visualizing relationships between two numerical variables and identifying outliers. As you gain more experience, you'll find scatterplots invaluable for uncovering stories within your data, such as the relationship between college costs and completion. Always consider how you can use color, labels, and additional data points to enhance the story your scatterplot tells, and leverage Plotly's interactivity (like tooltips on hover) to provide more detail without cluttering the main visual."
