By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to upload data, choose appropriate chart types, customize visual elements, and add annotations to your visualizations. You'll practice these skills by creating a scatterplot of colleges, gaining hands-on experience in transforming raw data into a publication ready graphic. This ability to quickly create professional visualizations will be invaluable for presenting your data findings in a clear and engaging manner."

In 2015, in lightning talks at the NICAR conference in Atlanta, Aisch demoed a project he had been building inside The New York Times called Mr. Chartmaker. It was a browser-based tool that allowed you to upload data, pick a chart type, change some text and publish a NYT-level graphic in minutes.\n",
                "\n",
                "Today, that seems like no big deal. Indeed, there were already online charting tools around that time. The problem? They were trying to be everything to everyone, and in the process, they could only make simple charts in very bland ways. Aisch manange to make **New York Times** level graphics with his online chart maker. \n",
                "\n",
                "Most of us in the room that day for the demo felt like we were watching the gods give fire to the mortals. It was a revelation. And we were all jealous as hell that this tool only existed inside the Times.\n",
                "\n",
                "Lucky for us, Aisch co-founded a company called Datawrapper. Technically, he started it before he went to work for the Times, and came back to it after he left. Today, Datawrapper does everything that demo showed us back in the day and more. And anyone can get an account for free. \n",

                "So you might be asking right now ... if it's so easy, why did we just go through all that stuff using R and `ggplot` to make graphics? Well, young scholar, the *reason* Datawrapper is so easy is *because* you just went through all that work to get to where we are now. Because you made graphics with your bare hands, you now understand the pieces that go into it. The thinking. The reason certain things are as they are. What charts require. All of the choices in Datawrapper -- once you get past some differences in what things are called and figure out what is where -- will make complete sense to you.\n",

Datawrapper works *great* for simple charts, especially ones that have to get done quick and put online to match the pace of news. But hopefully, the gods of journalism will smile upon you and bless you with a story and some ambition that goes beyond what Datawrapper can handle.
