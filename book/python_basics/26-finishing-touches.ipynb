You've learned to apply clean themes, adjust text hierarchy, customize chart elements, and fine-tune layouts for both standard Plotly charts and custom-built waffle charts. Remember, these finishing touches are not just cosmetic - they're required for effectively communicating your data story to your audience. Always consider how these final adjustments can enhance the clarity and impact of your visualizations."
