You've learned how to prepare your data, construct the basic chart structure with lines and markers, highlight specific series, customize axes, and add text annotations for clarity. Remember, slope charts are particularly effective for showing how different entities (like states in our example) change relative to each other over two distinct points in time. As you go forward, you'll find slope charts to be a valuable addition to your visualization toolkit, especially when you need to clearly communicate before-and-after comparisons or year-over-year changes in a compelling and easy-to-understand format."
