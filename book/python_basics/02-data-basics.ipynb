By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the basic structure of datasets, including rows and columns, and how to view and inspect data in Python. You'll learn about different data types you'll encounter, how to import data into Python, and key functions like `head()` and `info()` for exploring your data."

    "## What is Data Journalism?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial, data journalism was using data as a source. In our computerized present, data is everywhere. But, like a human source, you need to know if your data actually knows the thing you want to know. Just because you have data doesn't mean you have answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in data journalism is finding data. Sometimes you can do that on your own -- governments have created open data portals to make it easier. Sometimes you need to ask around -- interview the humans that work at an agency and see what they track and if they have the data. That might require a public records request at the state or local level, or a Freedom of Information Act request at the federal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 in data journalism is looking at what exactly is in your data. This process is so important that it requires multiple different lessons to come back to the same question: What is in my data? And is it what I need?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You have to explore the data to understand what questions can you even ask the data to begin with,\" said MaryJo Webster of the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \"What's the knowledge that this source has? What are the fields of information? What's the breadth of knowledge? You know, all the different fields, the columns that might have different variables that will tell you something more deep. How rich is that? How far back in time does the data go? Geographically, is it the entire state? Is it just one county? That's that breadth of knowledge.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You've got to explore that first to even think about what you could do with it.\""

Your online life. Any time you buy something. It's everywhere. News, like life, is no different. Modernity is drowning in data, and more comes along all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In news, and in this class, we'll be dealing largely with two kinds of data: **event level data and summary data**. It's not hard to envision event level data. A car accident. A crime. A fire. They are the events that make up the whole. Combine them together -- summarize them -- and you'll have some notion of how the year went. What we usually see is summary data -- who wants to scroll through 365 days of crime data to figure out if crime was up or down?\n",

    "The first thing we need to do is get some data to work with. We do that by reading it in. In our case, we're going to read data from a CSV file -- a comma-separated values file. Most of the data we'll use in this class will come from CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code looks like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "census = pd.read_csv('../_static/census-estimates/minnesota.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part -- `census` -- is the **name of your variable**. A variable is just a name of a thing that stores stuff. In this case, our variable is a DataFrame, which is pandas' way of storing tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `=` bit is the variable assignment operator. It's how we know we're assigning something to a word. Think of the equals sign as saying \"Take everything on the right of this equals sign and stuff it into the thing on the left.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pd.read_csv` bits are pretty obvious, except for one thing. What happens in the quote marks is the path to the data. In there, I have to tell Python where it will find the data. The easiest thing to do when you are working on your own computer, if you are confused about how to find your data, is to put your data in the same folder as your notebook. If you do that, then you just need to put the name of the file in there (filename.csv). For this exercise, we're pulling the data from a local folder.\n",

For example, every zip code in Boston starts with 0. If you record that as a number, your zip code will become a four digit number, which isn't a zip code anymore."

    "In this lesson, you've learned essential concepts for working with data in Python. We covered how to import data using `pd.read_csv()`, and explored ways to inspect your data using `head()` and `info()`. You now understand that data are typically organized into rows (individual elements like counties) and columns (variables or attributes). We discussed the importance of the header row in naming your columns, which is crucial for data manipulation. You've also been introduced to common data types you'll encounter: numeric, object (string), datetime, and boolean. Remember, always start by loading the pandas library, give your imported data a descriptive name, and take time to understand the structure of your dataset. These foundational skills will be vital as you progress in your data analysis journey."
