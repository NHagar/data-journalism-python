You've practiced creating basic dumbbell charts by combining line and marker traces, and enhancing them with color and size adjustments. You've also seen how reordering the chart elements using `update_layout` can help tell a clearer story, as demonstrated with the comparison of in-state and out-of-state tuition costs across colleges. Remember, dumbbell charts are particularly effective when the gap between two values is the key story you want to tell. Consider how this visualization technique can help you highlight important comparisons in your datasets."
